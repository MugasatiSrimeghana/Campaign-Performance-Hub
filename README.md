# Campaign-Performance-Hub
The goal of this project is to maximize a hub's year-end sale campaign by providing a gold membership, which is priced at $499 (down from $999) and offers a 20% discount on all purchases, only to current customers. Finding the client groups most likely to buy this offer is the aim. Through a focused marketing strategy, the store hopes to optimize sales and minimize campaign expenses by anticipating the most receptive clients.

## Detailed Synopsys
In order to assist the hub cut marketing expenses while increasing sales, this study attempts to determine which customers are most likely to take advantage of the new gold membership offer. A dashboard utilizing **Power BI** was created to forecast consumer replies and examine the main elements influencing their behavior based on customer demographics, buying patterns, and previous campaign responses.

Important findings show that 86% of overall sales are made by Elite Customers, who are mainly adults who have recently made purchases. The membership is most likely to be purchased by married and educated people, particularly those who enjoy non-vegetarian foods like meat and fish. Although in-store purchases predominate, initiatives to promote internet sales ought to be investigated. Gold products are especially popular among married couples, which makes them a reliable source of income.

## The Viewpoints
#### Group 1: Category of Elite Customers

   * The Elite Customer group, which is made up of high-value clients who frequently make purchases, accounts for 86% of total sales.  The offer of gold membership is most likely to be well received by this group.

 #### Group 2: Prospective Clients

  * Married people make up the majority of potential customers, and those with more education are more likely to buy. They also show a predilection for non-vegetarian foods like meat and fish, which they pair with wine. 

 #### Group 3: Online versus In-Store Purchases

   * Consumers prefer to shop in-store rather than online, and Elite Customers are less likely to take advantage of online deals.As a result, our Elite Customers use online deals comparatively infrequently.

#### Group 4: Low Complaint Rate

   * Over the years, the store has consistently maintained a low complaint rate, demonstrating high levels of consumer satisfaction.This shows that consumers prefer to buy products from our business and is a good sign of customer happiness.

 #### Group 5: Interest in Gold Products

 * Over the last three years, married couples have consistently expressed interest in Gold Products, making them a prime target for exclusive promotions.Targeted marketing campaigns can be made to fit the requirements and tastes of this demographic group, which is a substantial source of income.

## Recommendations

The following suggestions can be made to solve the problem statement in light of the main observations:

#### Group 1: Elite Clients to Target

   * Target Elite Customers, who make up a sizable portion of overall sales and are most likely to buy the offer, with the gold membership campaign. By focusing on the most receptive demographic, campaign expenses can be decreased. 

 #### Group 2: Give Married or Graduated Clients Priority

   * Based on this data, give married or recent graduates priority inside the Elite Customer Category as they are more likely to make purchases.  To increase their engagement and conversion rates, a greater percentage of the campaign's resources should be directed on reaching out to this particular client category with suitable offers and incentives.

#### Group 3: Tailored Advertising

   * Concentrate on preserving and enhancing this high degree of client happiness by adjusting the offer to suit the tastes of prospective clients as revealed by the observations.  To appeal to the target population, highlight the availability of non-vegetarian foods such meat and fish, as well as the possibility of enjoying them with wine. These foods must be delivered to clients promptly and in good condition in order to establish our online presence.

 #### Group 4: Promote Online Buying

   * Even though in-store purchases are more common, look into ways to encourage Elite Customers to emphasize the ease and convenience of online transactions, making sure that they are aware of the advantages and savings that are available to them. This will encourage them to make more purchases online and take advantage of the website's gold membership offer.

#### Group 5: Strengthen Promotions for Gold Products

  * Since married couples have continuously demonstrated a strong affinity for buying gold products, special offers or exclusive discounts for gold products that precisely address their requirements and preferences should be made available to this category.
  

 #### Group 6: Constantly Track and Improve

   * To improve and optimize the target promotions for upcoming campaigns, regularly examine consumer data, customer feedback, and campaign outcomes.
   * To make data-driven changes and enhancements, monitor customer response rates, conversion rates, and the overall efficacy of your campaign.


## Premises and Warnings
#### Premises:

* Customer behavior and preferences are accurately reflected in the data, especially with regard to their buying patterns and reactions to promotions.
* Elite Customers' inclination for in-store shopping won't change significantly, and they will continue to show the same buying trends in upcoming campaigns.
  
#### Warnings:

* Because the predictive model is based on historical data, it might not accurately reflect modifications in consumer preferences or outside variables like changes in the economy.
* Even if the gold membership is reasonably priced, not all customer groups may find it appealing, and the campaign's efficacy may differ depending on the area or client profile.

## Conclusion
